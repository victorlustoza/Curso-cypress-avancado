  - How to wait for an element to be visible before interacting with it
  - How to simulate using the keyboard instead of clicking a button in search features
  - How to wait for HTTP requests before moving forward with testing
- How to organize different tests in their specific contexts
- How to read browser `localStorage`
- How to make element selectors more specific
- How to simplify repetitive commands
- How to intercept and mock an external API to test the frontend independent of the backend
- How to simulate server and network errors
